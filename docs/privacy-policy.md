# Privacy Policy

I, Boryana Deniker, built the SG Med app as a free app and it is provided for use as is.

## Data

The only data the app handles is the first record from any Type 2 NFC token scanned by it. The contents of that record are only stored in memory for processing and not shared outside the application on this device. It should be cleared by fully quitting the app. If that fails to work, uninstalling the app will definitely delete it.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately, after they are posted on this page.
